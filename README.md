# performance_change_calculator
This python based jupyter notebook file demonstrate how better can you perform if you increase your effort by x% every day until n days.
This was a fun project for me to do to practice writing user-input based functions in python, and it reminds me to increase my game by at least 1% everyday.

Do you have suggestions for making it better, for example including a date-based duration, or incorporating weekends/holidays? Let me know if this is of interest, and I will be happy to make those changes.
